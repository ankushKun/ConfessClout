    <h2>WTH is ConfessClout?</h2>
    <p>
        Often on many Discord servers I have found a channel in which users were able to send confessions anonymously
        <br><i>(any sort of message that one would not like to say publicly...kinda)</i><br><br>
        That means without disclosing the identity of the person who sent that message. <br>
        All this was done through the use of bots, the user would DM the bot <br> and the bot would send the message in
        its specific channel on the server.
        <br><br>
        Sounds fun right? <br>
        In a server that I manage on Discord, we have our own custom confession bot, <br>
        and it's really nice seeing people sharing their thoughts (both good and bad).
        <br><br>
        Many people are unable to release their thoughts and vent somewhere when needed, and end up keeping things to
        themselves, which has a negative effect on them :(
        <br><br><br>
        We have a saying in our language
    <h3><q>‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§Æ‡§® ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§æ‡§§ ‡§¶‡•Ç‡§∏‡§∞‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§¨‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡•á ‡§∏‡•á ‡§Æ‡§® ‡§π‡§≤‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ ‡§∞‡§π‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡•§</q></h3>
    Which basically means you feel much better after expressing yourself to others :)
    </p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>All you need to do is Login with your deso account, type in your confession, hit send and your confession will be
        posted on <a href="https://bitclout.com/u/ConfessClout" target="_blank">@ConfessClout</a> üöÄ</p>
    <p>The login is there to make sure only the people who are on DeSo can send confessions.</p>
    <p>Your public key or account details will never be stored or associated with any confession you make.</p>
